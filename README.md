# GIT Cheet Sheet

## Basics of GIT

- **Git** is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code and collaborate on projects.

- **Repository**: A repository is a directory where all the files for a project are stored, along with a history of all the changes made to the files.

- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of all the files in the repository at a certain point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes made.

- **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. By default, there is a "master" branch, but developers can create new branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

- **Merging**: Merging is the process of taking the changes made in one branch and applying them to another branch.

- **Clone**: Clone is the command used to copy a repository from a remote server to your local machine.

- **Add & Commit**: The "add" command stages changes, and the "commit" command saves those changes with a message describing what was done.

- **Push & Pull**: The "push" command uploads your commits to a remote repository, and the "pull" command downloads any new commits from the remote repository.
